# What are axioms?

A set of irreducible rules that form the basis for complex and beautiful design.

Axioms are the design ideas that establish our brand. They include functions, mixins, and variables that are available as a common library between Sprout's marketing sites and apps. Axioms do not add any classes to the compiled CSS.

Also included is our version of a reset/normalize to provide sensible default styles.
